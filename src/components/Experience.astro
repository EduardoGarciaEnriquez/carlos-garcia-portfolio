      "As a front-end developer, some of my daily tasks were fixing bugs, refactoring code, adding new features, managing software workflow with agile methodology, consuming APIs from back-end services, and handling data from API responses to update the user interface. Additionally, I often found myself refactoring projects for responsiveness and accessibility, upgrading class components to functional components using React hooks, and refactoring CSS files using SASS for sustainability and easier maintenance. Some of the technologies I've worked with are ReactJS, HTML5, CSS3, React-Redux, SASS, Ant Design, Axios, Redux-Saga, JavaScript, propTypes, git, and bitbucket."

Consuming APIs from back-end services and handling data responses to update user interfaces were integral parts of my role. I also focused on refining projects for better responsiveness and accessibility, transitioning from class components to functional ones using React hooks, and optimizing CSS with SASS for long-term maintainability.'
